 Instructions:
 Note that the Python files and trained models will be placed in the barn-shared folder three days
 after the deadline. The project currently contains five Python files, cnn_classification_cifar10.py,
 dataset.py, model.py, train_buildings.py, test.py
 Below are the instructions for training the building model on CCI (currently).
-----------------------------------------------------
 cd scratch-shared

 ./conda init

 //log in again

 conda activate pytorch-env-shared

 //schedule the code to run

 srun-t 30â€“gres=gpu:1 python train_buildings.py
-----------------------------------------------------
 // To test the pretrained model

 srun-t 30-gres=gpu:1 python test.py <path_to_data_dir> 
<name_of_label_file.csv>

 //This program will load the trained model (the model we trained before submission) from the
 models folder, then it will evaluate and print the accuracy on the data in the directory provide
